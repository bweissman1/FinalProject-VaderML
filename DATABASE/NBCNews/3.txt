Donald Trump may have the new title of president-elect, but he’s still plugging his old gig as the head of a massive business empire.

Trump’s transition website is now equipped with the official “.gov” federal web address.

And while the “Meet The President Elect” section is typically dedicated to outlining an official's vision and background, there is one particular emphasis in his resume.

More than one-quarter of Trump's bio refers to his business properties around the world.

The focus on Trump's individual private properties, from which he draws his income, is a break from the political norms of a candidate transitioning into the White House.

Barack Obama, for example, had a similar bio page during his transition as president elect that outlined his career achievements and charitable work. Nowhere did Obama mention his books, which were best-sellers and the driving source of his wealth while he served in the White House.

As a candidate, Trump notably leveraged press coverage to double as free advertising for his business ventures.

He took the press on a tour of his new golf course in Scotland, refusing to answer questions on foreign policy until after he touted the resort’s success. And he hosted droves of reporters to cover a ribbon-cutting ceremony for his new hotel property in Washington, D.C., which opened just weeks before the election.

The vast scope of Trump’s business ventures sets up an unprecedented dynamic in untangling any potential conflicts of interest before he assumes office.
