In his Talking Points Memo tonight, Bill O'Reilly said there's an effort on the far left to oppose President Donald Trump and get him out of office.

He said it's clear that many on the left - and in the media - had a vested interest in seeing President Obama succeed, and those same people have a vested interest in seeing Trump fail.

"What Americans have to understand is that there is an organized effort to get Donald Trump out of office," O'Reilly said.

He pointed to this past weekend's Woman's March, which was organized by "far-left groups" that receive millions from activist George Soros.

O'Reilly explained that Soros had ties to 50 groups that attended the march this weekend, and according to the Media Research Center, he pumped $90 million into those groups.

"Some of the top march organizers were members of the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton's campaign, Bernie Sanders' campaign," O'Reilly said. "This was not some spontaneous uprising. This was a well-thought-out political spectacle, designed to denigrate the new president."

He said there's nothing wrong with peaceful protest, but throwing around "insane charges" of fascism and racism just demean out democratic system.

"It is clear the far left will not give President Trump a chance and will do everything it can to get him out of office before his term is over."
