President Donald Trump answered critics of his immigration restrictions from seven high-risk countries in the Middle East, sending a message out on Twitter.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer teared up during a press conference on Sunday, calling Trump’s executive order “mean spirited and un-American.” On Monday, he stated his intent to ask for a vote in the Senate to repeal Trump’s order.

Trump did not signal any intention of backing down. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, he dismissed Schumer’s tears as “fake.”

On Twitter, he sent a message that he was pleased with the results of his executive order.

Trump also sent his press secretary Sean Spicer and his senior advisor Stephen Miller to respond to the backlash in TV interviews on Monday morning.

Trump reminded critics that he campaigned on the idea of extreme vetting for people coming into the country, admitting that at some points it would not be nice.
