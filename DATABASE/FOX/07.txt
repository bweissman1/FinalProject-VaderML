An episode of crime drama “Law & Order: SVU” inspired by President-elect Donald Trump has been bumped from its scheduled Nov. 16 premiere date by NBC. The episode, titled “Unstoppable,” has been replaced by an episode of “Chicago P.D.” The scheduling shift results from a change to NBC’s lineup last week when the network pulled original episodes of its Wednesday-night dramas and chose to air reruns against Fox’s telecast of game seven of the World Series.

“Unstoppable” stars actor Gary Cole as a Donald Trump-esque presidential candidate who faces damaging and sordid accusations from several women. Both it and “Great Expectations,” the episode that had been slated for Nov. 9, will now air at a later date, possibly next year. Nov. 16 will feature back-to-back episodes of “Chicago P.D.” as that show builds toward a crossover storyline with NBC’s related “Chicago” dramas.

“Unstoppable” has been the subject of continuous shuffling on NBC’s schedule. The episode of the long-running Dick Wolf-produced procedural had been envisioned by series writers as the second episode of the current season, which premiered Sept. 21, but NBC originally scheduled it for Oct. 12. It since moved to Oct. 26 and Nov. 16, and had at one time been believed to be slated for Nov. 9, the day after election day.

The schedule shuffling came as accusations surfaced of Trump sexually assaulting multiple women after a tape leaked featuring boasting of past instances of sexual assault in conversation with then-“Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush.
