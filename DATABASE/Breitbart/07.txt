President-Elect Donald Trump revealed private details of his phone calls with Hillary and Bill Clinton after he defeated Hillary in the presidential election.

“It was a lovely call, and it was a tough call for her,” Donald Trump explained during an interview with CBS 60 Minutes, adding that the failed Democratic candidate for president “couldn’t have been nicer” during the phone call.

“She just said, ‘Congratulations, Donald, well done,’” Trump recalled.

Trump sat down with 60 Minutes for an interview that will air Sunday. Excerpts of the interview were released to the press and aired on CBS Evening News.

Trump also revealed that former president Bill Clinton also called him days later.

“He couldn’t have been more gracious,” Trump said. “He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he’s ever seen. He was very, very, really, very nice.”

Trump called Hillary a “great competitor” who was “very strong and very smart” and described Bill Clinton as a “very talented guy.”

But when asked if he would ask former president Bill Clinton for advice, he did not commit.

“Certainly, I would certainly think about that,” he concluded.
