The News Has Feelings is a ML applied project for Software Design Spring 2018 by Daena Michelle Cedillo, John-Edwin Gadasu, Benjamin Weissman.

In our divided world today, accusations of media bias sully the political process and stifle intellectual progress through a perpetual focus on eradicating any emotion behind admonition. Many on both sides of the political aisle see the other sideâ€™s news organizations as overly emotional and negative. To put these accusations the the test, Vader built a program attempts to understand the landscape through sentiment analysis and comparison.

### Prequisites for running on Heroku
Note: Because Heroku does not support matplotlib, graphing a point on the site is not allowed, so though your point will not be graphed live, a dummy graph has been used a place holder so as to not hinder user experience.

JavaScript also increases lag time. For best experience, use Mozilla Firefox and allow the page to refresh if experiencing opacity issues.
