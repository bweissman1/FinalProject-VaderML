Khizr Khan is calling on Donald Trump to quell the concerns of Americans who fear for their safety following Trump's victory on Tuesday.

"It is his obligation to address the concerns of all Americans, not only those who have voted for him," the Gold Star father said in an interview on "All In With Chris Hayes" on Friday night.

"We are told by our leadership that we must come together and we must accept him as our leader," Khan said of the new president-elect. "Wait a minute, it does not work that way."

Khan blamed continued protests across America on Trump making no attempt to help unite the country in the days since the election.

"I want to remind Mr. Trump that you have not gotten the majority of popular vote," Khan said. "These folks are scared because of his statements and his policies, and he has not extended a hand of courtesy ... or affection."

Khan said he is on a mission to help the nation move forward and heal, even if it takes giving Trump civics lessons himself.

"He may have won the electoral college, but he must win the respect of everyone. And respect is not given by demand. Respect is earned."

Khan warned that protests may only expand and get more difficult to detail if Trump remains silent.

"It has been three days and we have not heard anything of reconciliation, anything of leading all of America forward."

Khan made waves after holding up a pocket-size U.S. constitution and challenging Trump to read it during an impassioned speech at the Democratic National Convention.

Khan's son, Muslim-American Army Captain Humayun Khan, was killed while serving in Iraq in 2004.
