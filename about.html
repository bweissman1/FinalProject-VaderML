    <p>In our divided world today, accusations of media bias sully the political process and stifle intellectual progress through a perpetual focus on eradicating any emotion behind admonition. Many on both sides of the political aisle see the other sideâ€™s news organizations as overly emotional and negative.&nbsp;<br></p>
    <p>We put these accusations to the test and developed a Python program that scrapes the web for news articles involving President Donald Trump from several discrete time periods, performed a sentiment analysis on them, and graphed the mean sentiment on three axes: positive, negative, and neutral.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We then sorted and visualized the data by media outlet, calculated the centroid of each one, and applied a k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Using this, our goal is to classify an article from an unknown news source into its correct place of origin.

    <p>To reach our goal, we approached the division of labor and execution by idenifying four areas:</p>
    <p>Strategy: To identify individual members strengths, assigning them to lead the part of the project they are most excited about completing.</p>
    <p>Research: Research news sources and compile a list of sources we wish to use to generate our data sets.&nbsp;
</p>
    <p>Implementation:
Build a scraper that extracts articles from various sources, parses the data, and vectorizes them. (Tfidf vectorizer, nltk) &nbsp;and perform various forms of analysis using machine learning methods .&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Visualization: Present the data in 3D space (using matplotlib) and on a GUI &nbsp;(hello, Flask!)</p>
