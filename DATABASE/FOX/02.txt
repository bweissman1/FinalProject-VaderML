Celebrities may not be ready to accept Donald Trump as the next president of the United States-- but Disney World is gearing up for America's new leader.

On a quarterly earnings call Thursday, Disney CEO Robert Iger told investors that the park is readying its iconic attraction—the Hall of Presidents at Disney’s Magic Kingdom park—for a new figure of the President-elect, reports Variety.

“Smooth transitions are good,” Iger said after President Barack Obama welcomed Trump to the White House Thursday afternoon.

“I will say on the smooth transitions front, we are going through a smooth transition as well. We have already prepared a bust of President-elect Trump to go into our Hall of the Presidents at Disney World.”

The Hall of Presidents first opened in 1971 in Liberty Square and features animatronic figures of every U.S. president from George Washington to Obama.

On Friday, Disney posted an official closure notice online stating that the attraction “will be closed for refurbishment from January 17 through June 29, 2017,” which theme park blog Inside the Magic speculates is to make improvements and install the new Trump figure.

On social media, some fans of the historic attraction lamented the new addition.
